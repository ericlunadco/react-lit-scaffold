For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template uses Conduit components. These are located on ReactWrappers.tsx (the documentation for those is in components.md) . Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
