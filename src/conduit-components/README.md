## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
